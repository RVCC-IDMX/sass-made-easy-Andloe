            <p>I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,</p>
            <p> And what can be the use of him is more than I can see</p>
            <p> He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head; </p>
            <p> And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed. </p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—</p>
            <p>Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;</p>
            <p>For he sometimes shoots up taller like an India-rubber ball,</p>
            <p>And he sometimes gets so little that there’s none of him at all.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>He hasn’t got a notion of how children ought to play,</p>
            <p>And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.</p>
            <p>He stays so close beside me, he’s a coward you can see;</p>
            <p>I’d think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!</p>
            <p>One morning, very early, before the sun was up,</p>
            <p>I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;</p>
            <p>But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,</p>
            <p>Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.</p>
