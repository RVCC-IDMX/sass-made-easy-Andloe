    <h1>My Shadow</h1>

    <h2>By Robert Louis Stevenson</h2>

    <p>I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
        And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
        He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
        And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.
        
        The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—
        Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
        For he sometimes shoots up taller like an India-rubber ball,
        And he sometimes gets so little that there’s none of him at all.
        
        He hasn’t got a notion of how children ought to play,
        And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.
        He stays so close beside me, he’s a coward you can see;
        I’d think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!
        
        One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
        I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
        But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,
        Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.</p>
